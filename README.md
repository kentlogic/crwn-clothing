#### One of the bigger projects I made using react + redux. This is part of react course I took during the ECQ / MECQ period. Firebase is used for the data storage and authentication and Stripe API for the payments.
The following were used for the project.
* React
* Redux
* Firebase - for data storage and authentication
* Stripe - for payments

Future plans for improvement:
* Add profile page
* Add more payment options
* Add more features such as order cancellation, refund and return.
